## About Me
I am a journalist/educator based in Brazil with a passion for technology and programming. I have a college degree in Journalism and Communication and worked as a reporter for the national edition of Playboy and as a freelance writer for other publications. Later, I pursued a degree in Literature at the University of São Paulo and became a teacher of Portuguese and Brazilian Literature.

Recently, I have been studying programming languages and have gained a strong understanding of Python, as well as the basics of JavaScript and SQL. I am particularly interested in the field of data science and hope to make a career transition into this area.

## My GitHub
On my GitHub, you will find projects that reflect my interests and expertise. I am particularly proud of my work with Python, which showcases my skills in Pandas and other data analysis  tools.

I am always looking to improve my programming skills and to collaborate with others on interesting projects. If you would like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to reach out via jp.jorge89@gmail.com.
